# CAT 2 OOP1
This project covers Encapsulation, Method Overloading & Overriding, Abstraction, and Exception Handling.


1) Encapsulation

Student class with private attributes (name, grade).

Public getter and setter methods.

Grade validation (must be between 0-100).


2) Method Overloading & Overriding

MathOperations class with overloaded multiply() methods:

Multiplies two integers.

Multiplies three integers.

Animal class with makeSound(), overridden in:

Dog (barks )

Cat (meows )

Demonstrates polymorphism.


3) Abstraction

Appliance (abstract class) with turnOn().

Fan and TV (subclasses) implement turnOn().

Shows abstraction by creating objects.


4) Exception Handling

Accepts two numbers and divides them.

Catches ArithmeticException for division by zero.
